# Implement-a-Matrix-Class-C-
Udacity- Intro to Self-Driving Cars

In this project you will implement a Matrix class in Python. Specifically, you will implement the following methods:

class Matrix:
  def determinant(self):
      # your code

  def trace(self):
      # your code

  def inverse(self):
      # your code

  def transpose(self):
     # your code

  # Overloaded operators

  def __add__(self,other):
    # your code

  def __sub__(self,other):
    # your code

  def __mul__(self,other):
    # your code
